Worship Manager is a project borne out of frustration, and also a desire to learn how to do a bunch of web stuff with Python.

At our church, we have coworkers who are in charge of preparing the PowerPoint slides for use on our Sunday worship sessions. 99% of the time, things go fine. However, ever so often, there will be a mis-typed word on the slides, or the error is mis-specified.
