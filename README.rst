---------------

Worship Manager is a project borne out of frustration, and also a desire to
learn how to do a bunch of web stuff with Python.

At our church, we have coworkers who are in charge of preparing the PowerPoint
slides for use on our Sunday worship sessions. 99% of the time, things go fine.
However, ever so often, there will be a mis-typed word on the slides, or the
error is mis-specified.

I am in the process of moving the song sheet files up to S3. I also would like
to move the databases off my local machine onto a hosted server, and make this
web app available to my church.
